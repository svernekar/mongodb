Relational databases uses the notion of databases into tables where each column reprsents a field and each riw represents a record.
Tables are related to each other with foreign keys also called as common columns
Scale-Up:
Server 8gb-16gb..Distrinuted computing
Structured data: str,int etc
Unstructured data :facebook like ,xml

Structured query language for definig and manipulating data
Queries are focused on collection of documents-Mongodb,Cassandra,redis

Radical Difference:
it allows you to storerelated items in one "row" in the same table.
Lack of scalability in RDBMS for OLTP applications(online transfer application)
data integrity at all levels
Speed,auto elasticity.

Document based NOSQL:
Deep nesting and complex structure
Doc with doc with in doc

Key-Value data base:
Word-Meaning,no structure
Quiclky saving basic information.

A single instance of Mongo can hold multiple databases.
Every doc had special key "_id"-->unique to collection
Javascript shell and Mongochef
Documnt:Key and associated values

{"MFD":"Welcome to MONGODB"}
key:"MFD"
value"Welcomr.....



Install mongodb
make dir c:\data\db
set the env path 
restart the system

go to terminal->mongo
mongo shell opens,tyoe show dbs
db.things.save({a:1,b:2})
db.things.find()
db.things.save({a:20,b:22,fruits:["orange","apple"]})
db.things.find().pretty()
db.things.insert({a:20,b:22,fruits:["orange","apple"]})
